Simply <strong>double-clicking the index.html file</strong> should work fine.
<br>The website is also hosted at roey-shap.github.io, though :)

Input validation:
<br>Relatively simple - confirm that the subject and contents of the email are non-empty.

Other JavaScript usage:
<br>-Implementing nice tooltips (courtesy of this concept: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_copy_clipboard.asp)
<br>
<br>-Making convenient pre-built components (see navbar/footer.js)
<br>
<br>I wanted to do even more complex stuff like having custom attributes that could be filled in 
(like src, desc for my custom Itch page inserts), but whatever, iteration
and a bit of messiness is fine.
